Check that the equations are correct, and are applied correctly. 

The multiprocessing implementation is working fine, there's not much to improve.

I have solved the problem where three different perspectives are showing the same thing. It was caused by a faulty implementation of matrix rotation. Each dimension is an axis, so swapping elements of the matrix along the same axis will only lead to trouble. 

I don't know what was wrong with the plot at first. It might have to do with COMSOL, investigate this *only* if have time.
